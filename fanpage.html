        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            LCD Soundsystem was founded as a solo studio project by DJ and multi-instrumentalist James Murphy in 2002. The New York City resident had his breakout single with "Losing My Edge", a song detailing his feelings of getting older in a youth dominated music scene. Coinciding with the move from the studio to concerts and touring, LCD Soundsystem eventually grew from a single man into a full eight member band. Throughout the decade, LCD Soundsystem would release three records in their signature style, mixing elements of punk rock and electronic dance music. At the height of their popularity, the band announced their mutual decision to retire, culminating in a 2011 farewell tour. However, LCD Soundsystem's exit would not be perminant; in 2016, LCD Soundsystem announced their return, along with a new album, <i>American Dream</i>.
